# Delta Live Tables Medallion Framework â€“ Project Roadmap

## Overview

Build a production-ready, decorator-based framework for Delta Live Tables (DLT) to simplify Medallion architecture implementation with strong support for governance, quality, and observability.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 Project Setup  
- [x] Initialize project repository  
- [x] Define project structure (core decorators, utils, config management)  
- [x] Integrate with Databricks and Delta Live Tables

### 1.2 Core Decorator System  
- [x] Implement `@medallion` universal decorator  
- [x] Implement `@bronze`, `@silver`, `@gold` decorators  
- [x] Support decorator stacking and precedence  
- [x] Implement decorator registry and metadata tracking  
- [x] Add YAML/JSON config loader  
- [x] Ensure compatibility with DLT import-time discovery

**Priority:** High  
**Goal:** Enable base functionality and configuration-driven pipelines

## Phase 2: Medallion Layer Support

### 2.1 Bronze Layer  
- [x] Schema validation engine  
- [x] Quarantine logic for invalid records  
- [x] Source metadata capture  
- [ ] PII detection and tagging  
- [ ] Support multiple input formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)

### 2.2 Silver Layer  
- [ ] SCD Type 1, 2, hybrid support  
- [ ] Deduplication and fuzzy matching  
- [ ] Cross-field validation rules  
- [ ] Data normalization libraries  
- [ ] CDC handling logic

### 2.3 Gold Layer  
- [ ] Dimensional model patterns (facts/dimensions)  
- [ ] Foreign key and reference checks  
- [ ] Aggregations and metric computation  
- [ ] Surrogate key generation  
- [ ] Business rule validations

**Priority:** High  
**Goal:** Provide layered transformation logic and data model enforcement

---

## Phase 3: Data Quality and Testing Framework

### 3.1 Validation Library  
- [ ] Prebuilt validators (emails, phone, regex, etc.)  
- [ ] Statistical validators (normal dist, outliers)  
- [ ] Custom validation extension system

### 3.2 Testing Infrastructure  
- [ ] Golden dataset management  
- [ ] Data simulation and chaos testing  
- [ ] Auto-test generation from profiles  
- [ ] Coverage reporting for transformations  
- [ ] A/B testing hooks

### 3.3 CI/CD Integration  
- [ ] Automated test execution on commit  
- [ ] Data quality gates for deployment  
- [ ] Drift detection and rollback logic  
- [ ] Environment-aware deployment workflow

**Priority:** Medium-High  
**Goal:** Establish robust and automated validation and test coverage

---

## Phase 4: Governance, Compliance, and Metadata

### 4.1 Governance  
- [ ] Column-level lineage and audit trails  
- [ ] Metadata registration (e.g., Collibra integration)  
- [ ] Sensitivity tagging (e.g., GDPR, CCPA classifications)  
- [ ] Access control and data masking helpers  
- [ ] Retention policy enforcement

### 4.2 Compliance  
- [ ] Regulation-aware decorators (GDPR, SOX, etc.)  
- [ ] Right-to-be-forgotten logic  
- [ ] PII column tracking  
- [ ] Regulatory reporting scaffolds

**Priority:** Medium  
**Goal:** Support enterprise readiness and auditability

---

## Phase 5: Monitoring, Observability, and Optimization

### 5.1 Monitoring  
- [ ] Logging system with verbosity levels  
- [ ] Metric tracking for quality and performance  
- [ ] Alerting integration (Slack, PagerDuty, etc.)  
- [ ] SLA dashboards and freshness tracking

### 5.2 Optimization  
- [ ] Partition and Z-ordering strategy suggestions  
- [ ] Caching controls and tuning  
- [ ] Query plan analysis and recommendation engine  
- [ ] Auto-scaling and cost-tracking integration

**Priority:** Medium  
**Goal:** Ensure operational excellence and performance

---

## Phase 6: Tooling and Developer Experience

### 6.1 VS Code Extension  
- [ ] Decorator syntax support  
- [ ] Autocompletion for configs and validation rules  
- [ ] Linting and config validation

### 6.2 Documentation Generator  
- [ ] Auto-generate docs from decorators and configs  
- [ ] Layer lineage visualization  
- [ ] Data dictionary export

**Priority:** Low-Medium  
**Goal:** Enhance DX and maintainability

---

## Phase 7: Extensibility and Plugin Architecture

- [ ] Support user-defined decorators  
- [ ] Add-on registry and dependency graph  
- [ ] Plugin loader and config merger

**Priority:** Low  
**Goal:** Make framework extensible for team-specific or enterprise needs
