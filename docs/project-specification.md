# Delta Live Tables Medallion Framework - Comprehensive Implementation Specification

This document provides comprehensive instructions for implementing a production-ready framework around Delta Live Tables (DLT) that simplifies the creation and management of tables within the Medallion architecture. The framework will enable developers to easily apply data governance, analytical warehousing best practices, and enterprise-grade data quality controls through a flexible decorator-based approach.

## Overview

The DLT Medallion Framework will provide a robust, configurable system that wraps Delta Live Tables functionality with best practices for data engineering in the Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers). It will use Python decorators to apply configurations and transformations while maintaining compatibility with DLT's import-time discovery requirements, with a strong emphasis on data quality, testing, and enterprise-grade features.

## Compute Environment
This framework will be running in a Databricks workspace and on a Spark cluster using a Databricks Runtime version of >= 15.4 LTS.

- "spark" is available as a variable within all notebooks but not in Python files. 
    - The Spark session should be obtained through SparkSession.getActiveSession() within Python files

## Core Requirements

### Architecture Foundation

1. **Decorator-Based Configuration**
   - Implement a flexible decorator system that can be applied to DLT transformation functions
   - Support both single all-in-one decorators (from configuration) and granular specialized decorators
   - Ensure all decorators are compatible with DLT's import-time discovery mechanism
   - Enable layering of multiple decorators on a single function with clear precedence rules
   - Provide VS Code extension for decorator validation and autocompletion

2. **Medallion Layer Support**
   - Bronze Layer: Focus on data ingestion, validation, and quarantining
   - Silver Layer: Support data normalization, deduplication, and SCD handling

## Technical Design

### Decorator System

```python
# Core decorators
@medallion(layer="bronze|silver|gold", config_path=None, **options)  # Comprehensive decorator
@bronze(config_path=None, **options)  # Layer-specific decorator
@silver(config_path=None, **options)  # Layer-specific decorator
@gold(config_path=None, **options)  # Layer-specific decorator

# Specialized decorators
@validate(rules=[], quarantine=True, **options)
@statistical_validate(distribution="normal|uniform", outlier_detection=True, **options)
@slowly_changing_dimension(type=2, track_columns=[], effective_from="effective_date", **options)
@reference_check(references={"column": "table.column"}, **options)
@metric(name, aggregation, dimensions=[], **options)
@governance(classification="pii|public|internal", owner="team", **options)
@test(golden_dataset="path", scenarios=["missing_values", "schema_change"], **options)
@performance(partitioning_strategy="time", z_order_columns=[], **options)
@documentation(description="", data_dictionary="path", **options)
@compliance(regulations=["gdpr", "ccpa", "sox"], **options)
```

### Function Signature Pattern

To ensure compatibility with DLT's import-time discovery, all decorated functions should follow a consistent pattern:

```python
@dlt.table
@medallion(layer="silver", config_path="configs/customer_transform.yaml")
@test(golden_dataset="test_data/customers_golden.parquet")
def transform_customers(spark: SparkSession) -> DataFrame:
    # Read from upstream tables or external sources
    source_df = spark.table("LIVE.bronze_customers")
    
    # Apply transformations
    transformed_df = apply_business_logic(source_df)
    
    # Return the transformed DataFrame
    return transformed_df
```
